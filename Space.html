<p style="text-align:left;"> Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly known as the Wide Field InfraRed Survey Telescope (WFIRST)) is a wide field telescope disigned look at large <br> portions of the night sky at once. While just as sensitive as Hubble it's able to look at a field 100 times wider than Hubble space telescope ever could.<br> What this allows astronomers to do is observe spots in the sky multiple times over the course of a month instead of every couple of years. This allows follow-up surveys to be done more often on things such as pulsars, flare stars, nebulas, and exoplanets.<br> Its primary mirror is 2.4 meters in diameter (7.9 feet) and carries multiple instruments. The wide field instrument it's what allows it to look at a wide field of the Sky.<br> Its Coronagraph instrument allows it to observe exoplanets by measuring the brightness of stars and finding exoplanets in the "dips" of brightness.<br> It's currently set to launch in 2027 and its primary mission is supposed to last around 10 years.</p>
